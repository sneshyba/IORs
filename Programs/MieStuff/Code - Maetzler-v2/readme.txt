Complex refractive indices of supercooled water
from 4500 to 1100 wavenumbers at T = 269, 258, 252, and 238 K.

The data files (Water_xxxK.txt, with xxx denoting the
temperature in K) contain three columns, separated by <TAB>.
First column: wavenumber in cm^(-1).
Second column: Real part (n) of the complex refractive index.
Third column: Imaginary part (k) of the complex refractive index.
